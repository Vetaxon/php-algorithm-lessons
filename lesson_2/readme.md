# PHP LESSONS

## Lesson sort. Part 2;

Practice.

To run practice use
```
php run.php
```
And you will see next message
```
"Sort failed.
 :-(( OPPS. You have not yet become a real programmer, keep on trying and you will succeed."
```
To complete practice realize function 'advancedSortArray' at task.php not using built-in php functions except count().
Use loops which you like and logical operators only and increment $itNum value for each iteration (like lesson_1).
Stack usage is not allowed!!!

If your 'advancedSortArray' function successfully sorts an array but does not exceed 'simpleSortArray' at simpleSort.php you will see
```
"Sort successful!
SORT PROFIT FAILED! You need reach profit +50%
To sort array with length 1500 were spent:
 - simple sort function: 2187041 iterations, 0.457 sec;
 - advanced sort function: 2187041 iterations, 0.474 sec;
Iterations profit = 0%
Time profit = -4%
:-(( OPPS. You have not yet become a real programmer, keep on trying and you will succeed."
```

The task will be completed when you achieve a profit of +50% compared to 'simpleSortArray' at simpleSort.php
And you will see next success message:
```
"Sort successful!
 SORT PROFIT REACHED!
 To sort array with length 1500 were spent:
  - simple sort function: 2175049 iterations, 0.457 sec;
  - advanced sort function: 953221 iterations, 0.216 sec;
 Iterations profit = 128%
 Time profit = 111%
 :-)) YEAR! You are a super programmer, the world needs you!!!"
```
