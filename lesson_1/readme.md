# PHP LESSONS

## Lesson sort. Part 1. Bubble sort;

Practice.

To run practice use
```
php run.php
```
And you will see next message
```
":-(( SORT FAILED"
```
To complete practice realize function 'sortArray' at task.php not using built-in php functions except count().
Use loops which you like and logical operators only and increment $itNum value for each iteration.
Stack usage is not allowed!!!
And you will see next success message:
```
":-)) SORT SUCCESSFUL! To sort an array of 20 in length you needed 361 iterations"
```
