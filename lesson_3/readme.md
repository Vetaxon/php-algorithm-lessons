# PHP LESSONS

## Lesson sort with stack. Part 3;

Practice.

To run practice use
```
php run.php
```
And you will see next message
```
":-(( SORT FAILED"
```
To complete practice realize function 'stackSortArray' at task.php not using built-in php functions.
Use loops which you like, logical operators and STACK and increment $itNum value for each iteration (like lesson_1).

And you will see next success message together with the comparison with 'advancedSortArray' at advancedSort.php:
```
":-)) SORT SUCCESSFUL!
 To sort array with length 1500 were spent:
  - stack sort function: 2251500 iterations, 0.363 sec;
  - advanced sort function: 905719 iterations, 0.213 sec;
 Iterations profit = -60%
 Time profit = -42%"
```
